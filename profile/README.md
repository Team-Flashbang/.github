# Team Flashbang

Welcome to Team Flashbang!
We are a team of developers who provide game server hosting for a variety of games and create open source software.

## Game Server Hosting

Our servers are optimized for performance and reliability, and we offer competitive pricing. 
Contact us if you are interested in our hosting services.

## Open Source Software

We create open source software with modern technologies, designed to be user-friendly and easy to use. 

Please note that not all of our repositories are currently public as we are migrating from closed-source to open-source. 
Stay tuned for more updates.
